> Project maintainers must accept your pull/merge requests for them to count toward your total
> 
> Have 4 pull/merge requests accepted between October 1 and October 31 to complete Hacktoberfest
> 
> The first 40,000 participants (maintainers and contributors) who complete Hacktoberfest can elect to receive one of two prizes: a tree planted in their name, or the Hacktoberfest 2022 t-shirt.
